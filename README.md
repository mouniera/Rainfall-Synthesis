## Contents

* Compression: codes related to section 2.b, 2.c and 2.d in the article (importance sampling, autoencodeur architecture and implementation). Codes related to PCA and Wavelets (section 3.c) are also in this folder. 
* Evaluation_compression: codes related to section 2.e in the article (object detection and object-oriented scores).
* Clustering_and_final_product: codes related to section 4 (SOM clustering and final product).

:warning: Database, autoencoder weights and SOM are not available. 

## Requirements

Each folder has its own requirement file: 2 yml files and 1 txt for a python virtual environnment. These codes run on different servers with different constraints.
